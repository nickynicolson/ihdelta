Available: Some Plants of the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR), Luzon, Philippines

The UP Baguio herbarium started as a student herbarium. It used to be very small with few collections from students and faculty researchers. At present, the herbarium has grown and is focused on keeping representative collections of the flora of the Cordillera Administrative Region, Luzon, Philippines. It is presently the only herbarium in the Region hence many students and researchers use the facility for the identification and verification of their plants for their studies.

The herbarium is active in the collection of plants from various parts of the Cordillera. 

The herbarium will be transferred to a new building, the Biodiversity Center of the Cordillera, in the future when the building will have been constructed. There is also a plan for establishing a database of all the collections which will be shared on line. The main constraint of the herbarium is funding to develop and improve it further. There is no library yet and the meager books are the personal collections of the person in charge.

The herbarium is open for donations of taxonomic books and other related literature and materials.",2018-01-12,,Baguio City,,,Philippines,Governor Pack Road,Baguio City,,,Philippines,"[63] 074 442 7231

Egler']","Updated Aug 2017 (large general update).  Implanted in the 70s under the coordination of Normélia Cláudia de Vasconcelos, the Herbarium of the Federal University of Pará (HF), originally belonging to the Department of Pharmacy, was transferred to the research building of the Institute of Biological Sciences (ICB) and later to the annex building of the ICB where it is currently.   It is mainly intended for didactic and pedagogical activities, mainly for undergraduate courses in Biological Sciences, but also receives material from collections of practical activities from other institutes. Teaching and extension projects, coordinated by UFPA botany teachers and with the participation of trainee students resulted in an increase in the number of exsicates, as well as the introduction of fruits, seeds (carpoteca) and flow! ers, deposited in alcohol for conservation. Currently, the herbarium has a collection of approximately 3,271 samples, belonging to 51 botanical orders and 151 families. As it has not yet been possible to catalog and update all the specimens (this procedure is being done with the help of students), we still do not know how many genera and species the herbarium has. At present, the curator of the Herbarium is the responsibility of  Dra. Roberta Macedo Cerqueira (Systematics and Plant Ecology Laboratory), who assumed this commitment at the end of August 2016. After changing the Herbarium curator, the order data, families and genera began to be updated for the classifications adopted by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG), which considers both molecular, morphological and anatomical data among others for the taxonomic classification of plants (the classification system previously adopted in the herbarium was the Engler System).",2018-01-12,,Belém,Pará,,Brazil,"Rua Augusto Correa, número 01",Belém,Pará,,Brazil,[55] 91 99243 1842,herbariohf@yahoo.com,,-1.45108,-48.476871,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

History and specificity:

Initiated at the beginning of the 19th century, now with about 250 000 samples, this collection reflects: 1) the history of Marseille: port open to the world, especially to the former French overseas territories and 2) the competence and influence of the 19th century Provençal naturalists. Today this herbarium includes: currently active herbaria, historical collections of the 19th and the 20th century of the South-East of the France and various herbaria relating to France's colonial history.

Currently active herbaria: 1) a general world herbarium of vascular plants initiated by Louis Castagne in 1820, 2) a general herbarium of vascular plants of France, 3) a general herbarium of vascular plants of the French Mediterranean area, 4) a cytogenetic herbarium of plants mainly collected and studied by J. Contandriopoulos and R. Verlaque, 5) a general world herbarium of lichen and 6) a general world herbarium of bryophyte.
Historical and prestigious collections of the 19th and the 20th century of the South-East of the France, corresponding to the first ""modern"" flora : 1) Herbier Louis Castagne (Catalogue des plantes qui croissent naturellement dans le département des Bouches-du-Rhône), 2) Honoré Ardoino (Flore analytique du département des Alpes-maritimes), 3) Honoré Roux (Catalogue des plantes de Provence spontanées ou généralement cultivées)… Various herbaria relating to France's colonial history : 1) Herbier Père Antoine Duss des Antilles (Flore phanérogamique des Antilles françaises, Guadeloupe et Martinique), 2) Herbier Henri Jumelle and Henri Perrier de la Bathie for Madagascar (numerous publications among the Catalogue des plantes de Madagascar), 3) Herbier Eugène Jacob de Cordemoy for La Réunion (Flore de l'Ile de la Réunion), used for the "" Flore des Mascareignes "", 4) Herbier Georg. Zenker (Cameroun), Herbier Boery (Mauritanie) for the "" Afrique Orientale Française "", 5) Herbier Pennel and Metzger for the Nouvelle Calédonie.

Moreover, the botanical collections of the University include the Musée Colonial de Marseille founded in 1893 as a part of the Institut Colonial de Marseille. This collection contains plant samples from overseas selected and used for food (fruits, vegetables, cereals, oils, etc.), as condiments and spices, for pharmaceuticals and for industry (rubber, wood, fibres, etc.).",2018-01-12,,Marseille,,,France,3 Place Victor-Hugo,Marseille Cedex 3,,,France,[33] 4 13 55 12 29,,,43.30389,5.37742,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It aims to present and showcase the native flora and habitats of the country to visitors and offers student, researchers and other botanic gardens (national and international) modern facilities and expertise in a state of the art research centre.    The OBG herbarium will be a major focus of the research centre. The herbarium is currently working closely with researchers from within Oman (e.g. Sultan Qaboos University) and international research institutions (e.g. Royal Botanic Gardens of Edinburgh). 

Oman’s native flora consists of approximately 1408 species, distributed within highly diverse habitats throughout the country. Remote and inaccessible areas of the country have yet to be studied. There is a relatively high possibility that new plant records will be discovered during the course of OBG’s field collecting trips.
 
Although we are at the beginning of a large task, the OBG herbarium collection is constantly growing and aims at increasing our specimen numbers vastly within the next two to three years.  On our many field trips throughout Oman, collecting herbarium vouchers is of critical importance. Of nearly all the species collected so far, multiple vouchers are available. The wide range of morphological variation within and between Oman’s diverse habitats is captured for many of the species. Vouchers of rare and endemic species are included in our collection as well.

In Oman, we are so far the only herbarium/institution that regularly undertakes scientific curation and physical curation inspections by trained staff and documents all procedures",2018-01-16,"Diwan of Royal Court

The Elizabeth Teter Lunn Herbarium is home to more than 5,000 plant specimens dating primarily from the turn of the twentieth century, with some being collected, purportedly, as early as 1848. Between the years 1895 and 1897. M.C. Jensen, a student and botanist, collected more than 80 specimens within the city of Lake Forest, IL, and added these to the College's collection.  At present, student Victoria Jones is in the process of writing a proposal for Lake Forest College to pay more attention to the collection and thus salvage this one-of-a-kind herbarium. This proposal reflects Victoria's senior-thesis topic and all of the tedious curatorial work she has committed to for the past three years. Victoria is currently working alongside Gerould Wilhelm, the foremost vascular plant botanist of the Chicago Region, to observe truth and beauty in each specimen of the ETL Herbarium. The outcome will be Gerould Wilhelm's & Laura Rericha's brand new book, ""Flora of the Chicago Region."" This book will update Swink & Wilhelm's ""Plants of the Chicago Region"" (1994).

The majority of the collection contains specimens from Illinois Beach State Park (IBSP) collected by Elizabeth Teter Lunn (professor at Lake Forest College) between the 1950s and mid-1970s. Lunn's interest in collecting from IBSP was based on an earlier study tallying the park's flora during the 1900s. The result was the publication of her guidebook, ""Plants of the Illinois Dunesland,"" completed in 1982 and published by The Illinois Dunesland Preservation Society.",2018-02-06,555 North Sheridan Road,Lake Forest,Illinois,60045,U.S.A.,555 North Sheridan Road,Lake Forest,Illinois,60045,U.S.A.,[01] 347 703 6576,"vaj2112@tc.columbia.edu

The herbarium contains specimens of 150 families of flowering plants along with collections of gymnosperms (conifers) and lower plants (non-seed producing plants) and all of these plant species are entirely indigenous in nature. The collection is currently being digitized, and the herbarium staff building an electronic Herbarium Catalogue containing images of the specimens and information taken from their collection labels.  The overall objective of digitization of the herbarium is to link this national wealth of the country with international research institutes and global web of knowledge.  The oldest specimens were collected some 50 years ago and 52 per cent of all flowering plant genera are represented in the collection.
 
The herbarium scientists are committed to making this important collection more accessible to botanists and others, wherever they may be, for use in their own projects: particularly in biodiversity, conservation and sustainable development.

The largermost of these sub-collections are the General Herbarium (FI-GEN), which incorporated the Herbarium libycum (15,000 specimens), the Philip Barker Webb's herbarium (Herbarium webbianum, FI-W), the Odoardo Beccari's Malesian herbarium (Herbarium beccarianum, FI-HB), the Micheli-Targioni herbarium (Herbarium michelianum, FI-M), the Rodolfo Emilio Giuseppe Pichi Sermolli's herbarium (Herbarium pichianum, FI-PS) and the Odoardo Beccari's palms herbarium (Herbarium palmarum, FI-HP).  The Botanical collections also includes a number of important, historical herbaria, such as the Andrea Cesalpino's and the Tuscan anonymous' herbaria (FI-CES and FI-MER, respectively, both dating backs to 16th century), and several ancillary collections (seeds, fruits, wood samples etc.). Due to the historical significance and uniqueness of most collections, physical loan is only possible for a limited number of FI-GEN and the ancillary collections specimens.

The Lee Park Herbarium was begun in 1937 as part of a WPA project to create a wildflower sanctuary. In addition to clearing land and planting native plants, the WPA workers were taught to collect and preserve specimens.  This part of the collection comprises 325 specimens; collection ended about 1940.  In the 1990s, Donna M.E. Ware, botanist at the College of William and Mary, began collecting in Lee Park anew.  Her goal was to determine if the original 325 species still grew there, and then expanded her project to collect other plants in the Park and watershed.  The Ware portion of the herbariam comprises 800 specimens and collection continues on this portion.

The herbarium collection includes 238 corresponding watercolors exquisitely painted by Bessie Neimeyer Marshall during the depression era in the 1930’s.

Herbarium of the Botany Department of the Saint Petersburg State University (LECB) is one of the largest University Herbarium of Russia. Its funds contain at least 800,000 herbarium sheets of higher plants. Now Herbarium collection is unique in the structure of the University, both in historical and in scientific terms by geographical coverage and systematic collection of funds, the existing type specimens (more than 3,500 types in the present, as we found). The type collection includes quite a significant amount of rare and original authentic specimens collected by various botanists such as E. Boissier (1810–1885), V. Borbas (1844–1905), H. Cuming (1791–1865), A.P. Decandolle (1778–1841), J. Forster (1754–1794), W. Hooker (1785–1865), G. Schimper (1804–1878), V. Tineo (1791–1856), W. Besser (1784–1842), А. Bunge (1803–1890), R. Hohenacker (1798–1872), G. Karelin (1801–1872), I. Kirilov(1822–1842), St. Krasheninnikov (1711–1755), C. Ledebour (1785–1851), R. Maack (1825–1886), K. Meinshausen (1819–1899), C. Meyer (1795–1855), А. Nordmann (1803–1866), P. Pallas (1741–1811), Ch. Steven (1781–1863), N. Turzaninov (1793–1863), А. Shrenk (1816–1876) etc. 

This Herbarium is probably one of the oldest as Russia storage facilities. The oldest herbarium specimens kept in LECB, belong to the middle of XVII century, or even the end of XVI century. Prelinnean specimens found by us in G. Bongard (1786–1839) and E. Lindemann (1825–1901) collections. Thus, according to Lindemann, in his collection during his lifetime were kept for more than 60 specimens collected by prelinnean F. Ambrosi (2 sheets), J. Breyn (1637–1697) (36), C. Bauhin (1) (1560–1624), A. Clegero (1) (he collected Juniperus japonica from Japan in 1688), J. Gerard (1545–1612) (1), J. Gmelin (1709–1755) (20). Many specimens found in Bongard’s herbarium, but how many relics it contains is difficult to say, since Bongard did not kept accounting herbarium revenues. Currently LECB, revealed more than 60 prelinnean specimens. The most of them were found in herbaria Bongard – specimens belonged to J. Commelin (1629–1692), C. Commelin (1668–1731), Breyn, P. Hermann (1646–1695), G. Steller (1709–1746), Gmelin etc., as well as in the herbarium Lindemann to Bauhin, Clegero, Breyn, Gmelin, etc. Currently, the oldest specimen found in LECB, is a specimen of C. Bauhin (1560–1624) – Jucca gloriosa L., without an exact date on the label, but, undoubtedly, belonged to Bauhin. Some of the old specimens have only historical interest, other are syntypes for species of C. Linnaeus (1707–1778), P. Pallas (1741–1811), J. Lamarck (1744–1829) and others, which is why value these specimens is particularly large. Examples of these types: Melanthium sibiricum L., Anthericum calyculatum L., Convolvolus ammannii Desr., Convolvulus lineatus L., Yucca gloriosa L., Andromeda stelleriana Pall., Claytonia arctica Adam, Claytonia sibirica L., Alyssum hyperboreum L., Phlox sibirica L. Thus, LECB is the third in Russia after Moscow State University Herbarium (MW) and Komarov Botanical Institute RAS (LE), which revealed prelinnean specimens, and some of which refers to syntypes of Linnean taxa. 

Private herbaria of H. G. Bongard (25 000 specimens) and E. E. Lindemann (200 000 specimens) housed at LECB.

Two contributors to Bongard’s collection deserve special mention: Johann Jacob Boeber (1746-1820) and Carl Ludwig Willdenow (1765-1812). 

It was Boeber’s personal herbarium the first collection to have been acquired in 1823 by the Department of Botany and added to Bongard’s own collection, comprising at the time 6,783 species. According to Bongard, Boeber’s collection of 7,000 specimens, representing 6,000 vascular plants and 1,000 cryptogams, was for the most part “badly pressed, or damaged by use”. Subsequently, and for reasons unknown, most of its specimens had been transferred to the Botanical Museum and are presently kept at the Herbarium of the Komarov Botanical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (LE). 

That Bongard’s collection at LECB includes some of Willdenow’s original specimens is not a widely known fact, either in Russia, or in the West. Our research indicates that there are 1,089 Willdenow’s specimens at LECB, with 104 of them authenticated by labels in his hand. This alone makes Bongard’s collection at LECB quite unique, both as a historic and scientific record. The only other Willdenow herbarium sheets in Russia, with labels in his hand, are found at LE (limited to algae), and at MW, the Moscow University Herbarium (about 50 sheets). 
Our preliminary study of Bongard’s collection at LECB identified around 1,450 type specimens (mostly syntypes and isotypes) that are currently kept in the Herbarium’s type collection of about 3,500 specimens. Among them, 42 type specimens of the Restionaceae, with 33 of them described by K.S. Kunth (1788-1850). Kunth, along with several other taxonomists, studied specimens collected by J.F. Drége (1794-1881) at the Cape of Good Hope and in other districts of the Cape Province in South Africa. There are also Bongard’s own type specimens, such as Соrallorhiza mertensiana Bong., collected by K.H. Mertens at Sitka, Alaska, with labels both in Bongard’s and Mertens’s hand. However, most of the types described by Bongard are kept at LE. The LECB specimens seem to be duplicates of those, with more detailed labels, found at LE.

Guarrera”. It holds about 17,000 specimens/samples, mostly microalgae, both marine and freshwater, inventoried since 1969. The herbarium includes the type materials of 506 taxa.
Besides recent and contemporary microalgae collections, the herbarium is house of historical diatom collections. Of them, the collection gathered by Frenguelli, pioneer of diatom studies in South America, is the most relevant. The Frenguelli Diatom Collection (FDC) constitutes a primary reference for worldwide diatomists since it allows access to information on diatom biodiversity extending back up to 100 years ago. The FDC represents the biodiversity existing in the past as it gathers samples from South America (Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Bolivia and Peru) and Antarctica. Additional gatherings from Italy, Egypt and Somalia also make up the collection.
Frenguelli ́s legacy also includes two worldwide known reference diatom collections: 
-“Collection Tempère et Peragallo (Diatomées du Monde Entier, 2e. Édition)” consists of a set of 1000 slides containing diatom assemblages from c. 900 localities, fossil or recent, freshwater and marine, from different parts of the world. Complete sets of slides are rare, housed in a few research institutions in Europe and USA. Presently, an almost complete set (995 of 1000 slides) of this collection is curated at the Herbarium LPC
-“Möller Collection” consists of 117 slides with strews of mixed diatom species, 5 slides of “Diatomaceen Typen-Platte” and 2 slides of “Diatomaceen Probe-Platte”. Both Typen- and  Probe-Platten are accompanied by an explanatory brochure. 
The Herbarium also houses more recent collections gathered by the following collectors:
- S.A. Guarrera: freshwater microalgae from different areas of Argentina, mainly from Patagonia and Pampasic regions.
-M.E. Ferrario: marine phytoplankton from Antarctica and Southwestern Atlantic Ocean.

FOUNDERS: Germán Arbeláez Serna and María Cristina Vélez Nauer, professors of the Degree Program in Biology at the University of Quindío. This process was supported directly by SANTIAGO DIAZ PIEDRAHITA of the Herbarium COL.
HUQ INVESTIGATORS: Carlos Alberto Agudelo H., María del Pilar Sepúlveda, Germán Darío Gómez M., Andrés Felipe Orozco C., Ana Lucía López G., Rocío Stella Suárez, Ricardo Elías Vega, Carlos Alberto López R., Paula Andrea Viveros , Johan Carvajal, Larri Álvarez, Juan Fernando Restrepo, Carlos Alonso Maya, Rigoberto Villa, Rodolfo López, Nodier Augusto Botero, Jaime Uribe Meléndez, Neyver Rivera, Martha Chacón, among others. Among the administrative staff stands out Edier Flórez Henao.
PUBLICATIONS: HUQ researchers have published numerous publications (approximately 100) in journals such as Flora de Colombia (Asteraceae and Amaranthaceae), Caldasia (Amaranthaceae), Biological News, Novon, Catalogs (Flora de Antioquia and Flora de Venezuela), abstract books of scientific events, among others. Books on taxonomy of mosses, Euphorbiaceae, wax palm, flórulas of some localities, four volumes of the magazine Flora Andina, etc. There are also online publications such as the Amaranthaceae in Neotropical Flowering Plants at https://www.kew.org/science/tropamerica/neotropikey.htm.
YOUNG RESEARCHERS: At least 10 young Colombians, biologists and graduates in Biology, funded by COLCIENCIAS have passed through HUQ and have developed studies on flora, palynology, taxonomy, ecology, among others.
INTERNATIONAL TRAINERS: Several interns from Croatia, Slovenia, Portugal, Brazil and Austria have conducted training and learning about the Andean flora in HUQ.
INTERNATIONAL NETWORKS: The HUQ belongs to the Latin American Association of Botany - ALB, through Carlos A. Agudelo has participated as a member of the Superior Council of the ALB between 2010 and 2018, is also part of the Colombian Herbarium Association - ACH, of which he was President between 1998 and 1999 with Carlos A. Agudelo and is linked to the Global Initiative project of plants to type the world types in JSTOR through Felipe Orozco. We also work in a network with researchers from the University of Luján and La Matanza, Argentina through a binational agreement. With Venezuelan researchers participated in the elaboration of the New Catalog of the Flora of Venezuela, through Carlos A. Agudelo Amaranthaceae was reviewed for that country.
MASTERY IN SCIENCES VEGETABLE BIOLOGY: the HUQ collection, its literature and researchers were fundamental to propose the creation of the Master in 2002 before the Ministry of National Education of Colombia. Through this program 28 botanists have graduated and by 2018 there are 25 more active.
SCIENTIFIC EVENTS: The HUQ staff has carried out numerous local, regional, national and international scientific events (symposiums, congresses), courses, workshops, forums, diplomas (Organic Agriculture, protected areas and medicinal plants (the latter led by Orozco C., being very successful), botanical expeditions, have participated in the Latin American congresses of Botany of the ALB such as Cartagena in Colombia 2002, Santo Domingo in Dominican Republic 2006, La Serena in Chile 2010 and Salvador de Bahia in Brazil in 2014.

The collections are divided in two sections: the new and the historical. 
The new collections include specimens of previous and current members of the Lab, as well as specimens of postgraduate students and doctoral candidates. Among them there are collections from: 
•	several mountainous areas and wetlands, mainly from Epirus, Macedonia and Thrace, including many areas of the NATURA 2000 network,
•	urban and rural areas,
•	a particularly rich collection of Lamiaceae plants

The historical collections of TAU hold more than 6,000 specimens, dating back from the early 19th century up to the late 30’s. Most come from the collections of Theodor von Heldreich, Theodore Orphanides, Joseph Sartori, Vasileios Tountas and Dimitrios Zaganiaris, as well as of many others.  There are at least 44 nomenclatural types, as well as many endemic and range restricted taxa.

What is remarkable about our activities is that beside each Herbarium voucher we tried to collect also seed or living materials. Currently all these materials are preserved under optimal conditions in herbarium cabinets (dried sheets), refrigerators and/or freezers (usually seeds) or under cultivation in our living collections (bulbous or rhizomatous plants). We devoted an extra code (IBRC code) than herbarium numbers to each specimen to link easily different types of collected materials.     

Hitherto, our team had more than 300 working days mission our country wide to collect both herbarium and living material of special Iranian flora. In parallel to our Center policy, we are going to raise continuously our collections inventories. 

Recently, we decided to gradually digitize our determined and labeled sheets and put them available via internet.

F. Andrews', 'A. W. Chapman']","The Troy University Herbarium (TROY) was established in 1954 as a teaching herbarium by Dr. Robert Dietz, who served as curator.  In 1961, the herbarium was moved from its original location in the basement of Bibb Graves Hall into the new science building, McCall Hall.  This 528 ft2 room served both as the herbarium and a paleobotany laboratory.  It remained in this location until 1988 when Dietz retired.  At that time, the herbarium was closed and all of the specimens were destroyed.  In 1997, the TROY Herbarium was reestablished by Dr. Alvin Diamond and Dr. Michael Woods.  In 1999, the collection had grown to approximately 3500 mounted specimens and the herbarium was moved to rooms 125 and 127 of the Math Science Complex (MSCX) (formally McCall Hall).  The two rooms totaled 443 ft2, which resulted in a 16% reduction in floor space from the previous location.  At the end of 2005, with 19 herbarium cabinets and a collection of approximately 19,000 mounted specimens, the herbarium had outgrown its space.  The Curators wrote a five-year plan for the herbarium and submitted it to the Troy University Administration.  With support of the Department Chair, Dean, Assistant Provost, and Provost, the herbarium was moved during 2006 to its current location, MSCX 216, which consists of 1058 ft2.  Since moving to its current location, the collection has grown to over 44,000 specimens with an average annual growth of over 2,000.  This makes TROY one of the fastest-growing herbarium in the southeastern United States.  Currently, 100 percent of all vascular plant specimens deposited in the TROY Herbarium have been databased and imaged.  Additionally, nonvascular plants have been databased. 

In 2017, the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) approved an additional 220 square foot room (MSCX 223) immediately across the hallway from the herbarium (MSCX 216).  This will allow us to relocate the plant dryer, freezer, mounting table, shelving for storage, filing cabinet for records pertaining to loans and exchanges, two data basing computers and imaging equipment to MSCX 223.  This will increase the safety of the collection by keeping all specimens outside of the herbarium until they have been processed and frozen.

The section with the CWU herbarium was also damaged, but not so badly; there and no windows in the herbarium premises anymore, but herbarium staff people came without hesitation to the place after the airstrikes and tried to cover the frames with cardboard and plywood. As far as I know, at present there is no loss of specimens, but under the current wet weather conditions the specimens are in fact open to the elements.            


Update from Oct 2020.  The name of the University was changed from Kharkiv State University to V. N. Karazin National University. CWU consists of three parts: 1) Kharkiv Botanical Garden (former CWB, now part of CWU); 2) Department of Botany; 3) Department of Mycology and Plant Resistance - CWU (Myc). (curator O.Yu. Akulov)

Information about the Mycological Herbarium
Dr. Olexander Akulov, curator of the Mycological Herbarium CWU-Myc (V.N. Karazin National University of Kharkiv, Ukraine) addresses you. I am very grateful to you for your kind letter of support and suggestions for help. This is very important for us.
 
I apologize for being late in replying to your letter. In the conditions of hostilities, it is difficult for me to answer letters in time. 
 
CWU-Myc – the oldest and second-largest collection of herbarised fungi in Ukraine, that has the status of the National Heritage of Ukraine. It holds about 40,000 specimens, including a large collection of old mycological exsiccates. There are many type specimens and memorial collections of world-famous scientists among them. The oldest specimen in our collection dates back to 1797. In modern times the collection is being intensively replenished with new materials. Some of them represent species that are new to science, including new genera.
 
Our herbarium has already survived several wars of the past. During WW2, part of the collection was not evacuated. It was placed in metal boxes and buried in the ground in the botanical garden, where it lay for several years. After the war, part of the collection that was evacuated never returned to Kharkiv. It was moved to Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, and still, it is housed in the KW herbarium. That part, which was buried underground, is still stored in CWU. 
 
The current war with Russia has caused enormous damage to the city of Kharkiv and the University in particular. In the large city with about 1.5 million citizens, about 20% of homes were destroyed, including several buildings of the University.
 
Fortunately, the herbarium has survived till now. The blast shattered the windows, but we closed them from rain and wind with plywood and polyethylene. The samples are stored in airtight metal boxes and are reasonably well protected. This will not protect the collection from a cruise missile or air bomb, but we will hope for the best. Now the Ukrainian army has pushed the invaders 40 km away from the city, so the shelling has decreased to some level.
 
None of us could have imagined that the horrors of war would be repeated in central Europe in the 21st century. We were not ready for such a situation. And the current force majeure has very clearly shown what we did right and where we made mistakes. 
 
As never before, we are aware of the importance of digitizing our funds. We were moving in that direction, but not fast enough. The University already has the status of Data publisher in GBIF. In collaboration with the University of Tartu via PlutoF platform, we have digitized about 7,000 samples. Information about 6,000 of them is already available to anyone in the world through the GBIF site. In 2021, we have prepared information for about another 2,000 specimens.
 
From the first days of the war, the main server of the University stopped working, and with it stopped the access to the electronic archive and catalog of the herbarium disappeared. Only due to the fact that Dr. O. Prylutskyi had a backup copy of the data and posted it on a server in Norway, access to the information was restored.
 
In 2021, we also started a revision of valuable specimens from the CWU-Myc herbarium using molecular genetic markers. We already obtained about 200 sequences. As a result of this work we are preparing a series of publications, for example, https://ukrbotj.co.ua/archive/79/2/84  Unfortunately, about 300 amplicons and all reagents for molecular research were lost during the war, and it will not be easy to restore them.",2022-05-04,,Kharkiv,,,Ukraine,4 Svobody Square,Kharkiv,,,Ukraine,"[380] 572 457 616

Description of the fungarium or fungal specimen:
The BIOTEC Fungal Herbarium was established in 1996 and registered with Index Herbariorum in 2003. The herbarium has resided in a purpose-built, climate- and humidity-controlled facility since 2003. BBH has been ISO9001-certified for quality management since 2004. There are over 100 species of type specimens in the containers. Nearly half of the greater than 49,000 specimens are insect pathogenic fungi. Other significant groups include macrofungi collected in Thailand from diverse Basidiomycota and Ascomycota phyla. In 2019, the repository changed its official name from BIOTEC to National Biobank of Thailand (NBT), but it remains under the National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA). The location has been relocated from the Storage Building to the Innovation Crustor II Tower A, 1st Floor, but remains within the same region of Thailand Science Park in Pathum Thani Province.

Description of the plant herbarium:
The BIOTEC Plant Herbarium is managed by the Ecology and Geo-informatics Lab, and specializes in storing and distributing voucher specimens from the biodiversity research plots established by the Lab. Its main plot is the 30-ha forest dynamics plot in Khao Yai National Park. Voucher specimens from other research projects within BIOTEC and outside collaborators are also stored.",2022-08-02,"144 Thailand Science Park, Phaholyothin Road",Khlong Nueng/Khlong Luang,Pathum thani,12120,Thailand,"144 Thailand Science Park, Phaholyothin Road",Khlong Nueng/Khlong Luang,Pathum thani,12120,Thailand,"[66] 2564 7000 ext. 71454 (Fungi)

The Museum has started its activities in 1995 with the formalization of an agreement with the city of Lajeado, when it installed the Botanical Garden of the city, with the objective to record the species existing in that space. With the closing of the agreement, the first name (Herbarium Lajeado Botanical Garden - HJBL) was replaced by HUNIVATES and later by the current name. Since then, the Herbarium has the legacy to support the documentation of regional plant diversity and the availability of this information to the scientific and general community. The herbarium is part of the Brazilian Network Herbarium and the Rio Grande do Sul Herbarium Network, and is connected to SpeciesLink network. The Herbarium of Vale do Taquari has also integrated INCT Virtual Herbarium of Flora and Fungi during the period of the project. The collection, organized according to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group III system, is fully computerized using the software database Brahms and available online at SpeciesLink. The samplings are originated from 15 Brazilian states, being most of them from the southern of Brazil, representative two of the existing biomes in Rio Grande do Sul (Pampa and Atlantic Forest). Considering the phytoecological formations, the most representative is the species that make up the Deciduous Forest of the Atlantic Forest biome, plant formation where the region of your location is located. The records of the species are distributed in 167 families, being Orchidaceae the most representative, followed by Asteraceae, Poaceae, Fabaceae, among others. It should be noted that the species of the Orchidaceae family are well represented in the Herbarium, constituting one of the largest collections of this family in Rio Grande do Sul.",2022-12-14,"Avenida Avelino Tallini, 171 Museu de Ciências,   Prédio 8",Lajeado,Rio Grande do Sul,95914-014,Brazil,"Avenida Avelino Tallini, 171  Museu de Ciências,  Prédio 8",Lajeado,Rio Grande do Sul,95914-014,Brazil,[55] 051 37147000 ext. 5505,herbario_mcn@univates.br,https://www.univates.br/mcn/colecoes/botanica,-29.4447,-51.9565,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6829,0,0,0,0,0

In the morning of 10 October 2022, the historical center of the City of Kyiv was hit by several russian missiles. As result, the historical buildings of the M.G. Kholodny Institute of Botany NAS of Ukraine and the National Herbarium of Ukraine (KW) were hit by the shock waves. Both buildings were hit by the shock waves and some fragments of missiles or damaged structures. About 20 windows were destroyed or severely damaged and was discovered several roof leaks (the holes were caused by the missile fragments). In particular, the ceiling in the Lesser Herbarium Hall has been damaged.  Currently, the urgent repair of the buildings has been completed, but the repair of the damage is ongoing.  (Detail report please see: https://ukrbotj.co.ua/archive/79/5/339). 

Updated Nov 2022:
An update from the KW Herbarium and our Institute: We were planning to start tomorrow (Wednesday) the serious repair and replacement of windows (damaged during the 10 October 2022 missile strikes) at the Institute of Botany and KW National Herbarium, but now it is hardly possible because the windows company will not be able to work under unstable power supply. The works will be most probably postponed.

Updated Oct 2022:
Email message received from Dr. Sergei Mosyakin, Director of the M. G. Kholodny Institute of Botany on 10 October 2022, reporting on damage  to KW during the recent Russian airstrikes:  Mostly windows, roofs, some non-critical structures. Anyway, some serious renovation will be needed before the winter. Right now, no irreversible loss of specimens, no harm to our staff. Our people who today worked here, did some basic repair and cleared the mess are fantastic. 

Updated January 2022.

Scope: The Flora and Lichenized Mycobiota of New Zealand. UNITEC has an emphasis on the northern part of New Zealand particularly the lichens of the Kermadec Islands, Northland, Kaipara (Mataia), Waitakere Ranges, urban Auckland, Auckland Regional Parks, Hauraki Gulf Islands (notable collections from Rangitoto, Motukaikoura and Tiritirimatangi), Waikato and Chatham Islands. Herbarium collections also reflect participation in Auckland Bioblitz (Auckland Domain, Auckland Botanical Gardens, Dingle Dell, Kepa Bush/Pourewa, Miranda, Smiths Bush, and Twin Streams (Opanuku Stream Catchment)). Invasive plants are also well represented reflecting staff research interests e.g., Taraxacum, and the courses taught by the facility.

The herbarium also holds DNA vouchers linked to the Applied Molecular Solutions Research Group (www.unitec.ac.nz/ams) and associated laboratory, and international lichen research consortia (PhyloRamalina, Lecanomics, Parsys).

The earliest collections are those donated collections from 1965 (Judy Nicholson, mainly South Island), with other later donations from the 1980s and 1990s, before active collecting began in 2001.

History: UNITEC was founded by Carol Elliott (nee Lockett) and Dan Blanchon in 2001. It is a teaching and research herbarium, with a major strength in New Zealand lichens, and which supports the research of an active lichen research group, as well as research on invasive and indigenous species.  Students learn herbarium specimen collection and preparation in three different courses in the Bachelor and Masters of Applied Science, and students volunteer in the herbarium to assist with accessioning and curation. The herbarium supports taxonomy education, particularly in lichenology, mycology, botany and biosecurity.

The main lichen collections of New Zealand Lichenologists Dan Blanchon, Andrew Marshall and Peter de Lange are held at UNITEC (including important lichen collections from the Kermadec and Chatham Islands, and northern New Zealand).

It was initially based on private collections of several researchers working on biodiversity assessment in Yugra State University. In 2017 YSU BC is registered as a data publisher in GBIF (https://www.gbif.org/publisher/fa46e267-4d25-41f5-bbbe-1cd75860b943).
The main goal of the YSU BC is to develop reference library of regional biodiversity, support research in systematics, ecology, phylogeny and applied disciplines, and manage associated biodiversity information in the Northern West Siberia. For that purpose, we are developing conditions for physical storage of samples, facilitating their scientific analysis, and applying modern computer technologies for storage, analysis and distribution of collection data.
The database of YSU BC is developed using Specify software. The Specify Web Portal (http://bioportal.ugrasu.ru/) available for the database search, browsing the map and images, and download. The database is shared through GBIF by IPT software using MySQL queries to each individual collection, including images of specimens.

The Philippines is among the Megadiversity countries in the world yet among the most critically endangered, placing it as a hotspot for conservation. The university established its botanic gardens to perform the international agenda of botanic gardens in conservation and to halt the loss of species in our region.

This collection has crucial importance because it hosts many specimens from the Carpathian region. We evacuated type specimens from our herbarium. But, unfortunately, we were unable to relocate the whole herbarium collection due to lack of space and finances. Our herbarium is deposited in metallic boxes that can resist mechanical damage and more or less to the water and humidity. However, these boxes are not temperature-resistant and therefore there is a high risk of smoldering of herbarium specimens inside these boxes in case of fire and high temperatures. It would be great to cover these boxes by fire-resistant thermo-isolation (e.g., by Rockwool RockSlab) to prevent the thermal damage of specimens for the period of war, but we have no such financial possibilities.The collection includes the former Herbarium of Shevchenko's Scientific Society",2023-11-21,5 Sudova str.,Lviv,,79000,Ukraine,18 Teatralna Street,Lviv,,79000,Ukraine,[380] 671 720 263,novikoffav@gmail.com,http://dc.smnh.org/,49.84162,24.01748,47,0,0,21632,0,0,1003,0,0,0,0,0,120080,0,0

The scientific value of herbaria as a botanical repository of Earth's current and past diversity is globally acknowledged. The Wildlife Institute of India Herbarium, recognized by the """"Index Herbariorum,"""" is listed among the 3567 network of herbaria worldwide cited using the acronym """"WII"""" in the scientific and botanical publications.

WII Herbarium was established in 1986 with a twofold purpose: (i) to create a repository of plant collections representing flora of different Protected Areas (PAs) of India and (ii) to develop a basic facility for aiding plant identification, floral inventory and access to plant databases for officer trainees, researchers, and students of WII.

One of unique features of WII herbarium is that it represents flora of a number of protected areas of India. Based on the floristic surveys and inventory of species, the database on the flora of protected areas namely Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, Bandhavgarh National Park, Grasslands in and around Pachmarhi Wildlife Sanctuary, Bodhghat submergence area, Madhya Pradesh, Great Himalayan National Park, Pin Valley National Park, Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary, Valley of Flowers National Park, Cold­arid region of Nanda Devi BR, Rajaji National Park, Eravikulam National Park, Protected areas of Andhra Pradesh, Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary, Gorumara National Park, Hemis National Park, Dachigam National Park, Rann of Kutch, Pakhui Wildlife Sanctuary, Arunachal Pradesh etc. has been prepared.",2025-06-16,Chandrabani,Dehra Dun,Uttarakhand,18,India,P.O.

It was the basis for Willkomm & Lange's Prodromus Florae Hispanicae (1861-1880), the first comprehensive Flora of most of the Iberian Peninsula - only now being superseded by the Flora iberica (Castroviejo et al., 1986-, Madrid) - and contains many type specimens of Iberian taxa. Not all Willkomm specimens are at COI and some are scattered in other institutes. But this is by far the largest assemblage of his material and he regarded it as his core collection which, as a whole he sold to Júlio Henriques, the founder of COI.

with financial support from the Danish International 
Development Agency (DANIDA) and became operational 
in 2003. It is the only herbarium in the country 
(Herbarium code THIM) listed in the Index Herbariorum 
 (https://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/) - a guide to the 
world’s herbaria and where only those collections that 
are permanent scientific repositories are included.
The main functions of the National Herbarium are to 
serve as the national repository of “Type” (A preserved 
specimen designated as a permanent reference for a 
new species, new genus or some other taxon) and 
voucher specimens of botanical collections; lead and 
coordinate plant systematics and taxonomy-related 
studies, including national floristic works; and identify 
conservation priority species in the country. The ancillary 
functions include providing taxonomic services to other 
agencies and stakeholders. and programs of the centres.
Over the past 20 years, the National Herbarium focussed 
on building its collections through routine collections 
programs, international collaborations and national 
thematic projects, including the (i) Bhutan fern project, 
(ii) Pilot project on invasive plant species of Bhutan, 
(iii) 
Comprehensive assessment of climate change impacts 
on endemic plant diversity, (iv) Impact assessment of 
invasive plants in Bhutan, (v) Red listing of Bhutan’s 
endemic plant species, and 
(vi) Biodiversity conservation 
and sustainable use in High Altitude Northern Areas of 
Bhutan (HANAs). Currently, the NH houses

Among these are 5 834 specimens from Reunion Island and 2 909 from the Scattered Islands. These herbaria are completed by samples preserved in alcohol, by seed banks and by a collection in silica gel. 
Formal partnerships were established since 2014 with the National Museum of Natural History (P, Paris, France) and with the Missouri Botanical Garden (MO, Saint Louis, USA). In 2019, new partnerships have been created with the herbaria of Mayotte (MAO), Geneve (G) and Madagascar (TAN).
Since July 2016, data from the herbarium of the Scattered Islands are available online on Tropicos® (search by typing \'CBNM\' in the name of Senior Collector).
At the beginning of 2023, the project \\\'Establishment of a protocol for digitization and online sharing of parts of the Scattered Islands herbarium\\\' was accepted thanks to the call for projects \\\'Contribution to naturalist knowledge\\\' of the INPN. The phase of digitization of herbarium parts was thus able to be initiated thanks to the acquisition of equipment and the training of CBNM\\\'s agents. A digitization protocol is being drafted and will subsequently be applied to all of the CBNM\\\'s herbaria.

Qarshi Botanical Garden,  is located on the premises of Qarshi Industries (Pvt.) Ltd, Industrial Estate Hattar, District Haripur, KPK, Pakistan on Taxila - Haripur road. It is 60 km from zero-point Islamabad. The geographical significance of Haripur district lies in the fact that its boundaries touch Abbotabad in north-east, Margalla hills of Islamabad in the South-east, Swat valley in the north-west and Sawabi district in the west. Besides, two districts of Punjab province i.e. Attock &Rawalpindi lie on the south-west & south-east respectively. Hattar Industrial Estate, Haripur falls under sub-tropical climatic zone and is situated in the foothills of Himalayas at the latitude 33º 44' to 34º 22' and longitude 72 º 35' to 73º 15' and 610 m above sea level. The mean minimum & maximum annual rainfall ranges from 800 - 1300 mm respectively & average winter temperature is 12oC and summer temperature is around 29oC. However, maximum temperature rises to >40ºC in summer and the lowest temperature in the winter fall below - 4ºC. Depending upon the weather conditions, sometime severe frost is observed during the month of December & January.
Medicinal plant species are those that provide people with medicines to prevent diseases, maintain health or cure ailment. Therefore, medicinal plants are important in the wellbeing of people yet most people are not aware about these species or their medicinal value. Examples of these plants include Aloe vera, Azadirachta indica and many others.
Medicinal plant species are of great value to mankind and other animals but not much emphasis is laid on their conservation, especially ex-situ conservation, given their ever dwindling natural habitats. Conservation of medicinal plants involves the sustainable utilization of medicinal plant resources that is in such a way that they satisfy the needs of today’s generation without hindering the ability of tomorrow’s generations to satisfy their own needs. This can easily be simplified as: “when you are eating today, remember to leave some for those who will be there tomorrow.”
Some of the plant species have already been extinct, other are declared threatened, endangered or rare mainly due to improper harvesting practices incompatible with their survival or habitat degradation due to landuse changes in favor of the development paradigm. The ever-dwindling natural habitats of these medicinal plants have left ex-situ conservation as the most preferable choice. This ex-situ conservation falls under the programs of institutions such as botanic gardens/herbal gardens that are encouraged by the Convention on Biological Diversity framework.
Therefore, Qarshi Industries (Pvt) Ltd. under its environmental policy and biodiversity conservation agenda has committed itself to protect, conserve and propagate endangered plant species in general and medicinal plant species in particular. To achieve the objectives, Qarshi Botanical Garden (QBG) was established in 2001 to conserve and propagate commercially important indigenous plant species.",2024-12-20,Hattar industrial Estate,Haripur,Pakistan,22610,Pakistan,Hattar industrial Estate,Haripur,Pakistan,22610,Pakistan,Qarshi Botanical Garden,rashid.afzal@qarshi.com,,33.897465,72.861396,5,0,0,7,0,0,10,0,0,12,0,0,1000,0,0

During its existence, the herbarium was located in the city of Vologda; still, it repeatedly changed its formal affiliations: Vologda Teachers Training Institute (1912–1918), Vologda Pedagogical Institute (1918–1923), Severnyi Krai Pedagogical Institute (1930–1932), Vologda State Pedagogical Institute (1932–1995), Vologda State Pedagogical University (1995–2014), and Vologda State University (2014–to date). For the last thirty years, the herbarium has a dual purpose and is used for educational and scientific purposes. For ease of use, it is divided into three sections: main, geographic, and demonstration sections. The main section includes collections of higher vascular plants and cryptogams (bryophytes and lichens). These collections mainly cover the Vologda Region, yet with high density. The main section comprises samples from at least 250 local floras. Herbarium possesses one isotype and two paratypes of Potamogeton × vepsicus. A number of specimens were reviewed by specialists in complex taxonomic groups: P. Uotila (Chenopodiaceae), A.N. Sennikov (Cotoneaster), A.A. Bobrov (Potamogetonaceae, Batrachium, Myriophyllum), V.G. Papchenkov (Salix, Typha). The collection of bryophytes was partially reviewed by E.A. Ignatova.

Chifa'],"Our collection of plants constitutes a Medicinal Ethnobotanical Herbarium, since the North of Argentina is a privileged area, not only due to the tradition of use of plant species in vernacular medicine, but also due to the extensive existing documentation regarding the use of plants by the aborigines in natural medicine, among which are the tribes (MOCOVÍ, WICHÍ, TOBA). That is why the systematization of the practices that revolve around the recovery of the use of medicinal plants began, where botanical, ecological and anthropological knowledge converge with a scientific basis of the connections that exist between cultural groups and their plant environment.

Entered June 2021.
 
This Herbarium, which the “Universidad nacional del Chaco Austral” proudly owns, was the imprint of the Agronomist Carlos Chifa back in 1994, being at that time the Facultad de Agroindustria belonging to UNNE (Universidad Nacional del Nordeste), who making use of his knowledge in the Botanical field and creating strong ties with the original peoples of the region, he knew how to create a large collection of medicinal plants, with more than 5,000 specimens. Serving not only as a source of information for the careers of Medicine, Pharmacy, Veterinary Medicine and Zootechnical Engineering, but also for scientific studies that have been carried out in our house of higher studies.
This information resulted in the Publication of 4 books, which are:

The Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) is Australia’s land ecosystem observatory and is enabled by the Australian Government’s National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS). 

TERN measures key terrestrial ecosystem attributes over time from continental scale to fields sites at hundreds of representative locations across Australia’s major biomes and openly provide model ready data that enable researchers to detect and interpret changes in land ecosystems. 

TERN’s Ecosystem Surveillance platform conducts field surveys and sampling across a national network of plots and transects to provide the data, samples and advice required for improved monitoring and assessment of Australia’s major ecosystem. The platform helps scientists and land managers better detect and quantify change in vegetation structure and composition, land cover and soil characteristics. 
The platform collects representative plant specimens within the 1ha plots and associated leaf tissue samples stored in Silica Gel. The specimens are thus part of a long-term continental scale ecological monitoring program with rich temporal data. Plant specimens are collected on each revisit; therefore, the collection differs to that of a traditional herbarium. The plant specimen collection represents 5,804 vascular plant species, equating to 24.18% of the Australian flora. As well as plant specimens and leaf tissue samples, soil samples are collected, including bulk density samples and soil metagenomic samples.

The plant specimens are stored in Adelaide, South Australia and are available to loan for downstream research.

Mardin Artuklu University Herbarium aims to detect, document, and collect all plant samples, including common, rare, endemic, food, ornamental, medicinal, and poisonous plant taxa, to preserve the plant diversity database of Mardin province.
Mardin province has a rich biodiversity due to the presence of Mediterranean, continental, and desert climates and the altitude between the mountain and the plain parts. Mardin province and its surroundings are among the ancient locations that have been adopted by humanity since the earliest periods of history. The fossil records show the use of plants dates to the Middle Palaeolithic period, approximately 60 000 years ago. Eight different plant species were identified on a human corpse found in 1960 in the Shanidar cave, which is very close to the province of Mardin. However, the historically rich plant biodiversity of Mardin province is under threat due to various reasons, such as the unconscious use of pesticides, the construction of dams and ponds, excessive and uncontrolled grazing, concretion and destruction of green areas, and industrial facilities. Therefore, documentation of floristic composition and preserving dried plant samples grown in Mardin province have significant importance in terms of biodiversity and plant conservation.",2024-12-20,Kızıltepe,Mardin,Southeastern Anatolia,47060,Turkey,Kızıltepe,Mardin,Southeastern Anatolia,47060,Turkey,+90 482 213 40 02 ext. 2110,mauherbarium@gmail.com,,37.33532,40.70685,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,320,0,0

The herbarium was collected by entire generations of collectors; more than 120 collectors took part in the collection. The Herbarium collection contains rare herbarium sheets that are over 40 years old. At the end of the 90s, the areas of geobotanical surveys were reduced and the number of Herbarium collections correspondingly decreased. But, starting in 2017, with the adoption of the Agroindustrial Complex Programs, the survey area increased again and, accordingly, the Herbarium Fund became necessary again as a reference material for young specialists. At the moment, in our Herbarium Fund we have 3,000 plant species and over 10,000 herbarium sheets. In recent years, Aitzhan M.A., Saibulatova V.B., Sharipov E.K., Baiseitov N.K. have been greatly involved in collecting the Herbarium and updating destroyed copies of Herbarium sheets.

IDFHU is located near Székesfehérvár, Fejér County in the Amádé-Bajzáth-Pappenhein mansion in the village of Iszkaszentgyörgy. It is surrounded by a 5 ha park and parkforest.
The herbarium and corresponding botanical exhibit and library occupy 430 m2 in 13 rooms and contains around 250 ,000 plant samples from 89800 different accessions, with particular emphasis on conifers and woody elements of the coniferous forests of Earth’s
temperate climate zones. 
 
History: goes back to 1971 when the Dendrological Documentation Project (DDP) was launched by Dr. Zsolt Debreczy at the Botanical Department of the Natural History
Museum in Budapest. Soon after when he and botanical illustrator Dr. Vera Csapody
published the applied-botanical book, “Gardens Green in Winter Too” in 1971, 
they realized the importance of the parallel study and documentation of wild- collected, and authentic cultivated specimens for morphological comparison. A research team with Dr. István Rácz and Dr. Gyöngyvér Biró was organized for photo documentation and library research, respectively, and several botanical illustrators contributed to the work.

From 1988-1991 the team continued its work at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University
and subsequently at the Massachusetts- based International Dendrological Research Institute, Inc. (I.D.R.I.), with the close collaboration of the non-profit organization Earthwatch, Inc. (EW). In 1995 Zsolt Debreczy left the Natural History Museum (BP) and has started to develop I.D.R.I.’s herbarium, which became the foundation of IDFHU’s current extensive collection.
 
Expeditions: in collaboration with EW (1991-1997) a worldwide documentation project
started with the assistance of 165 EW volunteers, and the subsequent research and documentation eventually covered the entire temperate zones in both Hemispheres.

Location: In 1999, for logistical reasons, IDRI’s rapidly growing herbarium moved into a 650 m2 building in Budakeszi, next to Budapest, and then, in 2023 to its current, even more ideal location. 

Complementary collections: fruit, seed and extensive cone (2800 pieces); wood collections (ca. 1000 samples); photograph collection (350 000 negatives and transparencies, partially scanned); original drawings (botanical artwork) created for ‘Conifers around the World I-II’ and the Dendrological Atlas (Conifers and other gymnosperms of the temperate climate zones and adjacent regions, in preparation).

The University of Dundee’s Herbarium contains over 15,000 plant specimens, including a large public collection of Angus flora, as well as comparative specimens from other parts of Scotland. It also has some more exotic plants from further afield, such as a fascinating 19th century collection of Darjeeling Ferns.
The Herbarium was begun by D'Arcy Thompson, Professor of Biology  at what was then University College Dundee, then developed by Patrick Geddes, the first Professor of Botany. Lack of resources forced Geddes to abandon his work on the collection, and only a few of the specimens that came to the University during his time survive today. The Herbarium does, however, contain many plant specimens from the 19th century, though these were acquired at a later date.
Following the gift of the Corstorphine Collection to the University in 1944, a later Botany lecturer, Dr Hugh Ingram, recommenced the active collection of herbarium specimens during the latter half of the 20th century. Various other researchers added to the collection until the decline of Botany teaching in the 1980s and 90s.",2025-01-23,"Hawkhill House, 5-7 Hawkhill Place",Dundee,Scotland,DD1 5HW,U.K.,c/o Museum Services,Dundee,Scotland,DD1 5HW,U.K.,[44] 01382 384310,museum@dundee.ac.uk,https://app.dundee.ac.uk/museum/collections/herbarium/index.html,56.5,-2.96667,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Mukemre, A. Dalar']","Eastern Anatolia is the largest (approximately 170 000 km2) of seven geographical divisions of Turkey with 14 provinces, bordering Iraq, Iran, Nakhichevan, Armenia, and Georgia. It is included in the Irano-Turanian phytogeographical region, covered with deciduous-mixed forests and deciduous tree steppes. The area is surrounded by coastal mountain ranges, which protects it from the moderating effect of sea breezes. Subsequently, the winters are cold and long, with snow lasting for several months. They are followed by very short and rainy springs, and hot and dry summers. The mountainous and strongly fragmentised area offers numerous microclimatic and ecological zones, which provided suitable conditions for the development of diverse flora.
      The local population has a comprehensive knowledge of traditional herbal medicines which are commonly used to prevent or to treat disease. This knowledge was developed over centuries, when Eastern Anatolia served as a passageway between the continents of Europe, Asia and Africa. A variety of flora, fauna and cultures owe their geographical spread to this passageway. Over many centuries a number of races and tribes originated from distant lands settled in Eastern Anatolia, bringing knowledge of plants and their various uses. This heritage, combined with the local flora, has contributed to an extensive use of plants in daily life as a medicine. The knowledge of herbal medicines in this region is still mostly passed on orally (with the exception of a few codices) from one generation of religious healers (referred to as‘seyh’) and local healers (‘hekim’) to the next.",2025-01-24,Merzan,Hakkari,Hakkari,30110,Turkey,Merzan,Hakkari,Hakkari,30110,TURKEY,"+90 544 604 83 65

Established with the contributions of renowned botanist Dr. Daniel Montesinos, the herbarium currently houses over 1,500 species meticulously collected by him throughout Peru. Additionally, it contains more than 1,000 specimens gathered by students, reflecting a collaborative effort to document the country’s rich biodiversity.

One of the most valuable aspects of the HCSP collection is the presence of isotypes, paratypes, and neotypes, particularly within the Caryophyllaceae and Asteraceae families. Dr. Montesinos' collections are highly regarded due to their broad geographic range and scientific accuracy, making them critical references for taxonomic and ecological studies. These specimens not only contribute to the understanding of Peru’s flora but also serve as an essential repository for researchers working on plant systematics and conservation.

The HCSP Herbarium continues to expand, fostering botanical research and providing an invaluable resource for students, scientists, and conservationists dedicated to the study of plant diversity in Peru.",2025-03-07,"Urb.
